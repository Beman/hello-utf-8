hello-utf-8
===========

Hello world in English and Chinese, with a couple of Unicode emoticons from above the BMP.

This repo provides a simple little test file to use in submitting bug reports for various programs that don't handle UTF-8 encoding.

It also includes the C++03 program that generated the file, and some screen shots that show how various programs and operating system handle the file.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons_%28Unicode_block%29 for a description of the Unicode Emoticons.
